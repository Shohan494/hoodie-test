Plugins
=======

You can extend your Hoodie backend in two ways

1.  App-specific plugins
2.  3rd party plugins

App-specific plugins
--------------------

You can extend your Hoodie’s client by creating the file
`hoodie/client/index.js` in your app’s repository, which should export a
Hoodie Client plugin &lt;https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-client\#hoodieplugin&gt;.
It will dynamically be bundled into your client accessible at the
`/hoodie/client.js` route.

You can extend your Hoodie’s server routes and API by creating
`hoodie/server/index.js` in your app’s, which should export a
hapi plugin &lt;https://hapijs.com/tutorials/plugins&gt;.

3rd party plugins
-----------------

Hoodie will soon support loading 3rd party plugins from npm packages.
You can watch [this pull
request](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/pull/482) for updates.

To get an idea how 3rd party plugins will work and look like, have a
