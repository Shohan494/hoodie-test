Hoodie API
==========

Hoodie provides two APIs

1.  The Hoodie Client API

    The Hoodie Client API is what you load into your web application
    using a script tag. It connects to your Hoodie Backend's routes

2.  The Hoodie Server API

    The Hoodie Server API is used within Hoodieâ€™s route handlers and by
    plugins to manage accounts, data and to securely integrate with 3rd
    party services.

The Hoodie Client API
---------------------

This library, commonly called **Hoodie Client**, is what you'll be
working with on the client side. It consists of:

-   [The Hoodie Client API](client/hoodie.html), which has a couple of
    useful helpers
-   [The account API](client/hoodie.account.html), which lets you do
    user authentication, such as signing users up, in and out
-   [The store API](client/hoodie.store.html), which provides means to
    store and retrieve data for each individial user
-   [The connectionStatus API](client/hoodie.connection-status), which
    provides helpers for connectivity.
-   [The log API](client/hoodie.log.html), which provides a nice API for
    logging all the things

The Hoodie Server API
---------------------

The Hoodie Server API is currently work-in-progress. But you can have a
look at the [Account Server
API](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-server-api) and the
[Store Server API](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store-server-api)
for a sneak peak.
