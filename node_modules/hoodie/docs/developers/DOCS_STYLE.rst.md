Documentation Style Guide
=========================

This guide provides style advice for how to write documentation. Please
take the time to read this before contributing a large change or update
to documentation.

Style helps you and your reader
-------------------------------

Word choice and writing style are a personal choice and we understand
documentation can be difficult to write. These recommendations have been
designed to help you write clear and beautiful documents.

Testing
-------

The [contributing to docs guide](CONTRIBUTING_DOCS.md) describes the
process to follow when updating documentation. This process includes
automatic testing. Testing provides you peace of mind that your
contribution won't contain typos, broken links or other style whoopsies.
Testing is not used to criticise your writing, we really love and
appreciate any contributions. Please be patience through the testing and
review process. Together we can keep Hoodie documentation awesome!
